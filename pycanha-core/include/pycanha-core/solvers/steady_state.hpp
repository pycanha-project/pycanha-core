/**
 * Newton linearisation of the radiation, assembled into a sparse matrix
 * whose pattern is built once in initialize(), or into a dense one, and solved
 * with a direct factorization (see Settings: storage, backend, factorization,
 * reuse_factors, pardiso.*, eigen.*). Each iteration refactorizes only when
 * the matrix values differ from those of the last factorization, so the second
 * iteration of a linear model, or a new solve of an unchanged model, costs
 * one solve with the existing factors. With fixed_couplings the couplings
 * are read once per solve() and the matrices are not compared. With
 * reuse_factors each iteration solves for the temperature change,
 * A dT = b - A T, so the residual of the iteration on old factors stays in a
 * change that shrinks as the solve converges.
 *
 * A singular matrix (a group of diffusive nodes without a path to a boundary
 * node) is reported as an ERROR and leaves the temperatures of that solve
 * untouched; a solve that does not converge within max_iterations logs a
 * WARN and keeps the temperatures of its last iteration.
 *
 * After a converged solve(), jacobian() and linear_response() answer what
 * the steady state does when a parameter or a load changes, to first order,
 * from one factorization of the network at the converged temperatures.
