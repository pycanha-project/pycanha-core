/**
 * A solver works on one model with one Settings. initialize() resolves the
 * settings (see resolve()), warns once about the set fields that do not
 * apply, and builds everything the solver needs; solve() runs it. The INIT
 * settings are frozen while the solver is initialised; the LIVE ones are read
 * again at every solve().
 *
 * solve() throws ModelChangedError when the model's nodes or coupling
 * patterns changed since initialize(), checked at the start and after every
 * callback. An iteration loop that stops at max_iterations logs one WARN
 * (and, in a transient, one summary WARN at the end); report() has the
 * details.
