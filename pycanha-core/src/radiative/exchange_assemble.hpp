// Backend-agnostic exchange assembly. Turning accumulated fixed-point
// deposits into an ExchangeResult is pure host arithmetic — no Vulkan, no
// Objective-C — so both backends call the same implementation instead of
// mirroring it.
//
// That matters more than ordinary de-duplication: the Metal backend cannot
// be compiled on a machine without a Mac, so a mistake mirrored into the
// .mm file produces no error, no warning and no failing test until someone
// with Apple hardware next builds the branch. Keeping the logic here means
// the only Metal-side code is a call.
//
// The traversal itself — the cache-blocked tile-pair walk, the sparse merge,
// the weight table, the CSR packing — is shared with the view-factor
// assembly and lives in pair_walk.hpp. What stays here is only what knows
// that a cell is fixed-point deposited energy.

//    on the host (Vulkan needs an explicit invalidate; Metal's unified
//    memory does not).
//  - Tiled: one host map per row. The GPU buffer only ever held one block
//    of scratch, which was drained into these maps after every dispatch.
//
// Cells hold energy in fixed point: the integer count of 1/fp_scale units
// deposited. Integer adds are associative, so the two layouts accumulate to
// the same cells and every number derived from them is bit-identical.
